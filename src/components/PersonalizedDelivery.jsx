          With our **Personalized Delivery** feature, you can seamlessly
          integrate Quranic verses into your daily life. Choose a time that
          suits your schedule, and we'll send thoughtfully curated verses
          directly to your inbox. Whether you prefer receiving them in the
          morning, during breaks, or at night, this feature ensures a consistent
          connection to the Quran.

          or monthly—to match your spiritual goals. Personalized Delivery is
          designed to support your journey, helping you stay motivated and
          inspired no matter how busy life gets.
